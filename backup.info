Usage for Backup programm:

OS:Linux
Backup files: use only text files with no extra protocol like .odt or Microsoft office Documents have...
  use only: .txt files ore just normal text files

compile: gcc backup.c -o backup.exe 
          - or youe an other name after -o ....
         
run it:
sudo ./backup.exe FileToBackup.txt

      ./"your output Name of the compiled Program..."
      FileToBackup.txt = your text file you want to backup...it can be namend what ever you want
      
donÂ´t do!!!!
chmod +s ./backup.exe
because that would make some big security risks!!!

Have fun :)
